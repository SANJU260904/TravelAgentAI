#  Travel Planner Agent

An AI-powered travel planning assistant that generates personalized itineraries based on user preferences such as location, duration, and interests. Built as part of the **IBM SkillsBuild Internship (Edunet Foundation)** in the **AI and Cloud domain**.


##  Overview

This project aims to simplify travel planning by using AI to create customized trip itineraries. Users can input a location and number of days, and the system will return a well-structured travel plan, leveraging AI generation and optional document retrieval via RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).



## ‚öô Features

-  AI-generated travel plans based on location
-  Backend logic built in Python
-  IBM Watsonx Granite Model integration (optional)
-  RAG-based support for document-aware responses
-  User-friendly interface built with Streamlit
-  IBM Cloud services for deployment and model simulation



##  Technologies Used

###  Programming & Tools
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook

###  AI & NLP
- IBM Watsonx.ai
- IBM Granite 13B Chat Model *(simulated due to region limitations)*
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

###  IBM Cloud Services
